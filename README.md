Hey so yea i read the doc.
Uhm, please dont call me fang , it makes me heavily uncomfortable.
So im writing this in the morning cus yesterday i couldnt but uhm, ill take a break, Since things in-game and irl are happening. (Example: My mum hit me)

But if i ever join pony town it might be just bcs i want to make a skin or Just play idk.

Please do **not** interact even if ur a friend/close friend, i need some space and want to calm down.

If u wanna come to me just for checking how i am thats okay, but not every minute.

Now im not trying to make yall feel guilty but this is really how i feel, Disgusting, Guilty (im the kne supposed to be it.) , Ugly and other bad things.

If someone else is also going thru these things i hope ur feeling better and heal.

Now, i dont wanna tag anyone here bcs i dont have permission , but if ur reading this (R) well im sorry, again. For everything ive made that made ur fam feel bad or even ur friends, As i said before im not trying to make u feel guilty , im just still saying sorry bcs yknow how i am, if i make something bad or make anyone feel bad, i always say sorry. Now if u wanna tell me everything please dont, but if its something important make a repository and ill read it.

I deleted those skins who looked the most as others, and if it still looks like them , then ill change something else.

Oh horrible fact, when i start to cry or feeling guilty , something makes me v•m1T.
(Sorry) 

So now, leave me some space.

[EDIT] - Hi i was checking on T or R github to see if they removed "Fang" , i saw that T changed it but R didnt, ill wait then.

But i wanted to thank T for adding some words (i noticed there was 1+ page) , And yes, i will take a break as i writed here in this READ.ME, somehow this makes me more calm, thank you very much.

-Kino
